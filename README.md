# AR Operations Analytics

## Overview
End-to-end Accounts Receivable (AR) analytics project using public invoice and payment data.  
The goal is to replicate a real-world monthly operations reporting workflow, including AR aging, customer payment behavior, and cash receipts analysis.

## Business Problem
Finance teams often rely on manual Excel processes to answer:
- How much AR is overdue?
- Which customers pay late?
- How are cash receipts trending?

This project demonstrates a structured, repeatable analytics pipeline to support these questions.


## Dataset
Source: Canada Open Data – Aging of Taxes and Other Accounts Receivable

The dataset simulates real-world accounts receivable aging data and is used as a stand-in for invoice and payment exports commonly received by finance teams.

The raw file is stored as:
- data_raw/chronoimpots-agingtaxes.csv

No confidential or client data is used.


## Pipeline
1. Ingest raw invoice and payment files  
2. Standardize and validate data  
3. Join invoices and payments  
4. Compute AR metrics  
5. Export analytics tables for reporting and dashboards

## Key Outputs
- AR aging snapshot
- Customer payment trends
- Cash receipts summaries
- Optional Power BI dashboard
